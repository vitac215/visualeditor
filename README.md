# Visual Editor


A simple visual editor written in vanilla Javascript (client-side only). jQuery is included only for Bootstrap dropdown.

Basic features include:
 * Images can be dragged and dropped onto any of the layout area cells
 * Layout area cells can be split vertically or horizontally in half to create two new layout cells, which can also be split further
 * Keyboard (arrow keys) shortcuts to split cells
 * Clicking and dragging one cell onto another swaps the images
 * Layout can be saved and retrieved from the dropdown menu under the 'load' button
